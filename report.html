            <h1>My Personal Report of The Site's Requirements</h1>
            <p>
                • I created a website for my father and my grandfather since they both own a construction company that
                specializes in apartment building and condominium (condo) construction. <br>
                • The site has five different pages that are meant to give information about the company and the
                different services that they offer. The header of this website has all the navigation links that take
                you to all these different sections of the site. <br>
                • The site’s screen is also resizable so the client can minimize it as they please, it also supports a
                layout for mobile devices. <br>
                • The style of the site is kept across all its different sections so that they client can get familiar
                with it easily. <br>
                • One of the sections of the website is the gallery. The gallery has some images of the projects of the
                company to show to people (Couldn’t get real images of the buildings due to the quarantine, so I used
                the computer-designed ones that look pretty similar to the actual buildings). Every image has an alt
                attribute that describes the content. <br>
                • All the pages have a favicon. <br>
                • All extra files that are non-HTML resources are organized as the instructions said in different
                directories with their respective names. <br>
                • This website was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No third-party tools were used to build this
                website. <br>
                • All the pages were validated without any warnings or errors neither for HTML, CSS, nor JavaScript
                files. <br>
                • The site was stored in a Git repository as expected and file names were entirely lower case containing
                alphanumeric characters only. <br>
                • Site was served out of port 8443 as expected. <br>
                • Site is only accessed through HTTPS as expected. <br>
                • The content is neatly aligned, and axes are visible. <br>
                • Site uses at least two different font faces. <br>
                • The site has its “contact us” section which contains a form as expected. <br>
                • The site contains links to external sites that takes the user to a different page to look at the
                interior design of one of the buildings in the about section. <br>
                • The source code is readable and formatted as expected. <br>
                • The site does include at least one animation powered by CSS or JavaScript <br>

            <h1>Website's Critique Written By The Client</h1>

            <p> As the owner of a construction company the main thing I was looking for an easy way for my clients to
                see
                our work and either want to hire us for their building needs. I don’t want them spending time going
                through my website digging to find things like, how to contact us, what different buildings we have, and
                our background. This website does just that. It is not overcrowded with material. It is easy to access
                and doesn’t give our clients overstimulation. It tells them what they need to know and forces them to
                contact us rather than being able to get every small detail on the sight –it makes them want more. Both
                the mobile app is user friendly and are accommodated to each device making it easy to access our website
                from anywhere. I could open the website on my computer and use it on my phone just as easy. When I open
                my browser up on my phone most websites make it very difficult to navigate but this website was almost
                easier on my phone. <br>
                <br>
                The only problem I have is, it doesn’t show case what our building look like enough. There are not
                enough pictures and designs of what we do. I want to be able to show our clients exactly what they want
                to see. I want to show them not just the outsides of our buildings but showcase some of the inside
                structures of our buildings. For our older clients it will be hard for them to see the white font with
                the city background. I do enjoy the city background but maybe when going into the description change it
                to a simple background to make it easier to read. Lastly, I would like to add to our, “services” tab
                that we would expand more than what is written. I don’t want to turn any clients away because we don’t
                directly state what they want done. <br> <br>
                Overall wonderfully put together site. I am excited to showcase our work and be able to get more
                customer flow because of this site.
