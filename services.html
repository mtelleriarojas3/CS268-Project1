                    apartment but independently
                    sellable and therefore regarded as real estate. The condominium building structure is divided into
                    several
                    units that are each separately owned, surrounded by common areas that are jointly owned. They look
                    like
                    single-family homes but in which the yards, corridors, building exteriors, and streets as well as
                    any recreational
