            <h1>My Personal Report of The Site</h1>
            <hr>
            <p> •	I created a website for my father and my grandfather since they both own a construction company that specializes in apartment and condominium (condo) building construction. 
                •	The site has five different pages that are meant to give information about the company and the different services that they offer. The header of this website has all the navigation links that take you to all these different sections of the site. 
                •	The site’s screen is also resizable so the client can minimize it as they please, it also supports a layout for mobile devices.
                •	The style of the site is kept across all its different sections so that they client can get familiar with it easily.  
                •	One of the sections of the website is the gallery. The gallery has some images of the projects of the company to show to people (Couldn’t get real images of the buildings due to the quarantine, so I used the computer-designed ones that look pretty similar to the actual buildings). Every image has an alt attribute that describes the content.
                •	All the pages have a favicon.
                •	All extra files that are non-HTML resources are organized as the instructions said in different directories with their respective names.  
                •	This website was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No third-party tools were used to build this website. 
                •	All the pages were validated without any warnings or errors neither for HTML, CSS, nor JavaScript files. 
                •	The site was stored in a Git repository as expected and file names were entirely lower case containing alphanumeric characters only. 
                •	Site was served out of port 8443 as expected
                •	Site is only accessed through HTTPS as expected
                •	The content is neatly aligned, and axes are visible.
                •	Site uses at least two different font faces.
                •	The site has its “contact us” section which contains a form as expected.
                •	The site contains links to external sites that takes the user to a different page to look at the interior design of one of the buildings in the about section.
                •	The source code  is readable and formatted as expected. 
                •	The site does include at least one animation powered by CSS or JavaScript

            <h1>Website's Critique Written By The Client</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>As the owner of a construction company the main thing I was looking for an easy way for my clients to see our work and either want to hire us for their building needs. I don’t want them spending time going through my website digging to find things like, how to contact us, what different buildings we have, and our background. This website does just that. It is not overcrowded  with material. It is easy to access and doesn’t give our clients overstimulation. It tells them what they need to know and forces them to contact us rather than being able to get every small detail on the sight –it makes them want more. Both the mobile app is user friendly and are accommodated to each device making it easy to access our website from anywhere. I could open the website on my computer and use it on my phone just as easy. When I open my browser up on my phone most websites make it very difficult to navigate but this website was almost easier on my phone.
                The only problem I have is, it doesn’t show case what our building look like enough. There are not enough pictures and designs of what we do. I want to be able to show our clients exactly what they want to see. I want to show them not just the outsides of our buildings but showcase some of the inside structures of our buildings. For our older clients it will be hard for them to see the white font with the city background. I do enjoy the city background but maybe when going into the description change it to a simple background to make it easier to read. Lastly, I would like to add to our, “services” tab that we would expand more than what is written. I don’t want to turn any clients away because we don’t directly state what they want done. 
                Overall wonderfully put together site. I am excited to showcase our work and be able to get more customer flow because of this site.
